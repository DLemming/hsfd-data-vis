# Data Visualization Streamlit App

A simple interactive dashboard for visualizing New York City taxi trip data. Explore trip durations, distances, fares, and more using intuitive controls and real-time plots.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DLemming/hsfd-data-vis.git
cd hsfd-data-vis
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for dependency management (faster than pip). To install all dependencies and activate venv, run:
```sh
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage

Make sure you're in the project root. Run the Streamlit app with:
```sh
streamlit run üè†_Home.py
```
